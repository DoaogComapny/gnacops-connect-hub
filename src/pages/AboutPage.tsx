                          At the Ghana National Council of Private Schools (GNACOPS), we believe that private education
                          is not a privilege for the few but a partnership for the nation's collective progress. Over
                          the years, GNACOPS has evolved into the central coordinating and representative body that
                          unites thousands of school proprietors, teachers, parents, and learners under one shared
                          vision — to deliver quality, equitable, and sustainable education for all.

                            Our role goes beyond coordination. We serve as a bridge between the private sector and the
                            state, ensuring that private schools operate within national policy frameworks while
                            enjoying the support, guidance, and representation they need to flourish. Through structured
                            collaboration with the Ministry of Education, NaSIA, GES, NaCCA, NTC, and other key
                            partners, GNACOPS has established a trusted ecosystem that enhances school quality,
                            professional capacity, and institutional compliance across the country. We recognize the
                            immense contributions of private schools — who today account for over 40% of Ghana's
                            educational access — and we are committed to supporting them with innovative policies,
                            financial partnerships, training, and technology that make them sustainable, credible, and
                            globally competitive. The future of education demands transformation. It calls for
                            innovation that bridges learning gaps, leadership that inspires accountability, and
                            collaboration that drives results. That is why GNACOPS continues to invest in research,
                            digital transformation, and policy advocacy — ensuring that private education not only
                            complements the national system but leads the way in redefining excellence. To every school
                            owner, teacher, and partner in this great mission — GNACOPS is your home. Together, we form
                            one united body, one shared voice, and one enduring purpose: to make quality education
                            accessible, relevant, and transformative for every Ghanaian child. Education is our nation's
                            greatest investment. Private education is our strongest ally in making it inclusive,
                            innovative, and future-ready.

                      that improve school governance, teacher quality, and operational efficiency. • Financial and
                      developmental opportunities through GNACOPS partnerships with local and international donors. • A

                      The Ghana National Council of Private Schools (GNACOPS) is a legally incorporated national

                      authority for all private pre-tertiary schools in Ghana. GNACOPS operates under the broad policy
                      supervision of the Ministry of Education (MoE) and collaborates with the Ghana Education Service
                      (GES), National Schools Inspectorate Authority (NaSIA), National Teaching Council (NTC), National

                      between private education and national education standards. Our Core Mandate Includes: 1.
                      Coordination of Private Education: Harmonize the operations of all private pre-tertiary schools in
                      Ghana to ensure consistency with national educational policies and standards. 2. Representation
                      and Advocacy: Serve as the unified national voice for the private education sector — representing
                      school owners, teachers, parents, and learners in national policy discussions and international
                      engagements. 3. Quality Assurance and Compliance Oversight: Work with NaSIA, NTC, and GES to
                      promote quality education delivery, teacher licensing, and adherence to approved curriculum and
                      infrastructure standards. 4. Policy Formulation and Advisory Role: Develop and recommend education
                      policies that strengthen private schools while supporting government's broader education
                      objectives. 5. Research and Innovation Promotion: Conduct sectoral research, promote EduTech
                      integration, and encourage innovative teaching and management practices across private schools. 6.
                      Financial and Institutional Support: Facilitate access to funding, grants, and partnerships that
                      enhance the sustainability of private education institutions. 7. Conflict Resolution and Support
                      Services: Provide mediation, legal guidance, and welfare services for school owners, teachers, and
                      students to maintain stability and harmony in the education ecosystem. 8. Monitoring and
                      Reporting: Track private school compliance with educational policies, ethics, and operational
                      standards, and report findings to relevant authorities for action. In fulfilling this mandate,
                      GNACOPS bridges the gap between regulation and innovation — ensuring that private schools not only
                      comply but also excel.

                    ⚖️ J. Jurisdiction of the Council
                  </AccordionTrigger>
                  <AccordionContent className="text-base text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                    <div className="whitespace-pre-line pt-2">
                      The Ghana National Council of Private Schools (GNACOPS) exercises national coordinating authority
                      over all private pre-tertiary education institutions in Ghana. This jurisdiction ensures that
                      private schools, their management bodies, teachers, and learners operate within a well-structured,
                      compliant, and self-sustaining framework that aligns with the national education policy and
                      regulatory standards. GNACOPS functions as the internal coordinating agency for the private
                      education sector, complementing the external regulatory role of the Ministry of Education (MoE),
                      the Ghana Education Service (GES), and the National Schools Inspectorate Authority (NaSIA). Its
                      jurisdiction extends across every dimension of the private pre-tertiary education ecosystem,
                      encompassing policy coordination, compliance monitoring, stakeholder engagement, and institutional
                      development. 1. Private Pre-Tertiary Schools GNACOPS's authority covers all registered and
                      accredited private institutions within the pre-tertiary level, including: • Private Kindergarten,
                      Primary, and Junior High Schools. • Private Senior High Schools, Technical, and Vocational
                      Institutions. • Faith-based, community-based, and corporate-owned schools. • Educational
                      institutions operating under special models such as international curricula, STEM, or alternative
                      learning systems that fall under Ghana's pre-tertiary category. Through coordination and
                      monitoring, GNACOPS ensures that these institutions operate ethically, deliver quality learning
                      outcomes, and comply with all national educational requirements. 2. School Proprietors and
                      Governing Bodies GNACOPS represents and supports: • School owners, directors, and boards of
                      governors who manage private pre-tertiary schools. • Associations, federations, and networks of
                      private school owners operating at district, regional, or national levels. • Faith-based and
                      mission institutions that contribute to private education delivery in Ghana. The Council provides
                      policy guidance, capacity building, and advisory services to strengthen governance and
                      institutional management across these bodies. 3. Teachers and Educational Staff The jurisdiction
                      of GNACOPS includes: • All teachers, administrators, and support staff within registered private
                      pre-tertiary institutions. • Licensed and certified educators operating under the supervision of
                      the National Teaching Council (NTC). • Non-teaching professionals contributing to school
                      operations such as guidance counselors, bursars, and ICT coordinators. GNACOPS works closely with
                      NTC and MoE to promote teacher professionalism, continuous professional development (CPD), and
                      adherence to ethical and performance standards. 4. Students and Parent Associations The Council
                      also extends its coordination to: • All learners enrolled in private pre-tertiary schools. •
                      Parent-Teacher Associations (PTAs) and School Management Committees (SMCs) functioning within the
                      private education sector. Through these partnerships, GNACOPS fosters accountability, learner
                      protection, and community participation in the governance and quality assurance processes of
                      private education. 5. Regulatory and Supervisory Partnerships GNACOPS collaborates with all major
                      education oversight agencies to harmonize standards and enhance quality in private education
                      delivery. Key partnerships include: • Ministry of Education (MoE) – for national policy alignment
                      and strategic direction. • Ghana Education Service (GES) – for teacher management, supervision,
                      and curriculum implementation. • National Schools Inspectorate Authority (NaSIA) – for school
                      inspection, accreditation, and compliance. • National Teaching Council (NTC) – for teacher
                      licensing and professional development. • National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NaCCA) –
                      for curriculum design and evaluation. • Commission for Technical and Vocational Education and
                      Training (CTVET) – for technical and vocational school coordination. Through these partnerships,
                      GNACOPS functions as the bridge between private education stakeholders and public regulatory
                      bodies, ensuring effective coordination, compliance, and mutual accountability. 6. Sectoral Scope
                      and Coordination Function GNACOPS's jurisdiction empowers it to: • Maintain a national database of
                      private schools, teachers, and learners. • Monitor compliance and operational standards across all
                      categories of private schools. • Coordinate communication between private education actors and
                      government regulators. • Represent the private sector in national and international educational
                      forums. • Provide technical and professional support to ensure that private schools remain aligned
                      with Ghana's education reform agenda. Through this broad jurisdiction, GNACOPS ensures that every
                      private education stakeholder — from the smallest rural kindergarten to the largest corporate
                      school network — operates under a unified, accountable, and forward-looking national system.
